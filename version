# 0.6.8. 'lazy maggot' features

Yep, another feature branch.
This time to fix fundamentals.

rc system sucks a lot and need acute focus of(for/as?) janitor.


## dev details

This branch shall be called as 'rc-clean'

repository
https://github.com/ugcasa/guru-client

branch in web
https://github.com/ugcasa/guru-client/tree/rc-clean


## 0) new version file

Can handle features list in 'version' file.
reads first line as version number $GURU_VERSION
and second as name $GURU_VERSION_NAME.

Feels like natural location to write down version changes
and keep simple feature checklists.

As an root level file can easily read by script.

I'll try it, lets see.

**todo:**

- [x] change done
- [ ] try it
    - [x] like it
    - [ ] hate it
- [ ] $GURU_VERSION_DESCRIPTION option
- [x] 'guru description' works


## 1) Next bad idea

Core clean up. Is messy now.

- [ ] new functions.sh what combines core level functions and functions from common.sh?

## 1) memes and fixes to backup

- [x] backup fix for store location folder issue
- [x] convert read, mostly variable name changes
- [x] placer can handle meme files. 'gr place memes' 9gsg patterns added


## 2) phone ssh tools

- [x] recognize when phone is connected
- [x] phone ssh server is on
- [x] phone daemon tools
- [x] test of all phone functions: passed
- [x] audio module fixes


## 3) some new modules

- [x] display module added to set brightness
- [x] vpn module added to tunnel shit
- [x] audio playlist updated to make it more intuitive
- [x] installer tiv uninstall method added, minecraft and unity installers added
- [x] mount uninstaller and availability check added
- [x] common gr.ask rewritten


## n) speak synthesizer

Guru needs a voice.

**todo:**

- [x] POC is working already, try option '-s'.
- [ ] make it really work
- [ ] how to inform module to produce readable text, verbose level 5?
- [ ] needs tag/whatever 'speaker ready module' or empty output


## n) rc system rewrite

Stink this trough.
It makes now no sense, it grow like that, not designed.

- [ ] core rc clean up
- [ ] learn how it works now ;D
- [ ] changes to project.sh
- [ ] changes to config.sh


## n) modules can run stand alone by default

Modules need to be able to run without .gururc.
Exception is core level modules,
those have veto do shit ever they want.

**todo:**

- [x] bash -x
- [ ] .gururc is generated badly


## 9) test
